How will I complete this project?

  1. Organize the folders for your module (application), to house both your code base and the tests.

  2. Write tests to cover all the methods to be written before development begins (TDD: Test Driven Development).

  3. Make logical assumptions where necessary.
Steps to evaluate.

  4. Code

    a. At Minimum

      i. The right visibility modifiers should be used.

      ii. The following concepts/constructs should be used as much as possible

          · Encapsulation

          · Inheritance

          · Polymorphism

          · Interfaces/Abstract classes

          · Single Responsibility for classes.

          · Abstraction

          · Aggregation

          · Composition

  5. Test Coverage (~80%)

    b. At Minimum

      iii. The tests should cover the methods as well as the conditions/procedures that the methods employ.
